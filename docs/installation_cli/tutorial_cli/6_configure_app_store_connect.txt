6. How to configure App Store Connect for Flutter app iOS deployment with Appollo
=================================================================================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to **link your Apple Developer account with Appollo**.

.. note::
  If you are using the free version of Appollo, you can only have **one** Apple developer account linked to your user account. 
  
  To **link multiple accounts**, you have to **subscribe to a paid subscription**, you can discover our available plans |appollo_sub|.

Step 1: How to get an Apple API key
===================================

Go to |apple_developer| and click on the **"Account"** menu.

Log into your Apple developer account if you need to.

|

You can now see the overview of your account.

Access **App Store Connect**.

You can also directly go to |apple_overview|.

Once that you are on the App Store Connect homepage, you can head over to **"Users and Access"**.

.. image:: /img/app-store-connect-home.jpg

  :align: center

|

You will see a list of the users. Go to the **"Keys"** tab to see a list of your keys and their status

To add a new key, press the **big "+" sign**.

To generate an API key, simply define its name, select the role of the user and click on generate.

For more information about role permissions, check out Apple Developer Program's |official_doc|.

**In this case, developer is a sufficient pick.**

Your API key has now been generated!

You have the possibility to **copy¹** the key id and to **download the API key²**.

.. danger:: **You can only download it ONCE. Make sure to save it in a safe place!**

**But wait, do not close that tab yet !**

Step 2: Link the API key in Appollo
===================================

Now that you have successfully generated your API key, you can use it in Appollo CLI to link your accounts.


To get Appollo running, use the following command: ``appollo``.

You will get the subsequent result:

|

If you do not have an Appollo account yet, you have to create one first.

To do so, simply enter ``appollo signup``.

And follow the prompt instructions.

.. image:: /img/appollo-signup.jpg
  :alt: Appollo signup
  :align: center

|

The starting command that will be of use for this tutorial is ``appollo apple``.

Therefore, you can type it in to see what you can do next.

.. image:: /img/appollo-apple.jpg

  :align: center

|

At this stage, you have 8 possible subcommands which are, ``add``, ``detail``, ``edit``, ``link``, ``ls``, ``refresh-devices``, ``rm`` and ``unlink``.

With these commands, you can manage the access between your Apple Developer account and Appollo.

You can **add** and **remove** an access or you can **list** all existing access.

You can also easily **get more information** about your Apple Developer account with the ``detail`` command and **link** or **unlink** an Appollo team with an Apple Developer account.

In this case, you want to add an access. So, type in ``appollo apple add``.

.. tip:: 
  You can always add ``--help`` to your command line to list all the options of the command. That way, you can see what your next action will be.

.. image:: /img/appollo-apple-add.jpg

If you use the ``add`` command, the CLI will ask you to complete the information step-by-step.

You can also directly type in all the required information like this:

.. code-block:: none

  appollo apple add --apple-id TEXT --name TEXT --key-id TEXT --issuer-id TEXT --private-key FILE



Step 3: Complete the required missing information and where to find it
======================================================================

Now that you know how to add an access between your Apple Developer account and Appollo, in this step, you will learn **where you can find the required information**.

For the **Apple ID**, you can find it on your |apple_developer_membership|.

Go to the **"Membership"** menu and there you will find it. It is actually your Apple **Team ID**.

Just **copy & paste** it into the CLI and hit enter to continue.

The next information you need is to give a **name** to your access.

You can name it however you want.

Next, is your **key ID**. The one you created earlier.

Go back to your App Store Connect, in the Users and Access menu and in the keys tab.

There will be your keys. You can easily **copy the key ID¹**.

You can also copy the **Issuer ID²** right above because it will be the next line Appollo will ask you to complete.

.. image:: /img/apple-id.jpg
  :alt: Apple Key ID
  :align: center

|

The **private key** is the last bit of information you need to complete. It is the **path** where you stored the file of the key you **downloaded³** earlier.

The path should look like this, depending on where you saved the file.

.. code-block:: python

    /Users/USERNAME/Downloads/AuthKey_KeyID.p8

You are told that your account was linked successfully with Appollo and you receive your **Appollo key**.

It will be useful later.

If you type in ``appollo apple ls``, you should now see your access.
