Your API key has now been generated!

You have the possibility to **copy¹** the key id and to **download the API key²**.

You are required to complete a form with your Apple developer account informations.

Once you are done, you can press the **Add** button.

Step 3: Complete the required missing information and where to find it
======================================================================

Now that you know how to add an access between your Apple Developer account and Odevio, in this step, you will learn **where you can find the required information**.

For the **Apple ID**, you can find it on your |apple_developer_membership|.

Go to the **"Membership Details"** section and there you will find it. It is actually your Apple **Team ID**.

Just **copy & paste** it into the client in the correct field.

  :alt: Apple Team ID
  :align: center

|

The next information you need is to give a **name** to your access.

You can name it however you want.

Next, is your **key ID**. The one you created earlier.

Go back to your App Store Connect, in the Users and Access menu and in the keys tab.

There will be your keys. You can easily **copy the key ID¹**.

You can also copy the **Issuer ID²** right above because it will be the next line Odevio will ask you to complete.

.. image:: /img/apple-id.jpg

The **private key** is the last bit of information you need to complete. It is the **path** where you stored the file of the key you **downloaded³** earlier.

**Select the file** where you stored your key. The path should look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    /Users/USERNAME/Downloads/AuthKey_KeyID.p8

Now that your Apple Developer account was linked successfully you should see it appear in the **Apple** section like this:
