9. How to publish a Flutter app on the App Store without a Mac
==============================================================

**Congratulations, you are almost done !**

For this last part of the tutorial, you will learn how to publish your Flutter iOS app on the App Store.

Create your app in the App Store
--------------------------------

The first thing you will want to do is to create an iOS app on |app_store_connect|.

.. image:: /img/apple-add-app.jpg
  :alt: Apple add app
  :align: center

|

You can give whatever name you would like.

Select the **bundle ID** from the list of App ID you have created earlier in the tutorial.

If you have no app ID, you can refer to the :ref:`chapter 3 <create_app_id>` of this tutorial.

Finally, for **SKU** you can choose anything you want as long as it is unique.

You now have access to a dashboard for your app. If you scroll down, you will see the **Build** section.

Build your app
--------------

Now that this done, go over the Appollo CLI and use the command ``appollo build start`` for your app.

And this time, for the build type: **publication**

Wait for Appollo to create and start the build.

Then, wait for Apple to send you an email like this one:

.. image:: /img/apple-mail-confirmation.jpg
  :alt: Apple app build confirmation mail
  :align: center

|

Publish your app on the App Store
---------------------------------

The build section should now look like this:

.. image:: /img/apple-build-select.jpg
  :alt: Apple build select button
  :align: center

|

You can now select your build from the list.

.. image:: /img/apple-build-list.jpg
  :alt: Apple build list view
  :align: center

|

Apple will ask you if your app responds to **encryption standards** and other standards **you have to comply to**.

**You did it!** Your build has been **successfully publish** on the app store.

.. warning:: **Do not forget to save your build! Scroll up to see the 'Save' button.**

For your app to be published on the app store, you still have to **complete any missing information** and then
you can submit it to Apple for review.

.. tip:: This type of build can also be published on TestFlight for more testing.

Usually it takes Apple a few days to test your application and approve it or decline it. In case it is declined you will
get an e-mail from Apple telling you why it is not approved (reasons are not always very specific). You can then fix
the issues and publish it again.
