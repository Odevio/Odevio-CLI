GitHub Actions
==============
The objective of this tutorial is show how to use Github Actions with `Appollo <https://github.com/Appollo-CLI/Appollo>`_ for releasing iOS apps with a CI solution.

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

To Follow this tutorial you will need :

* An appollo account linked to your Apple Developer Account. `Learn how to setup Appollo <https://appollo.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial/2_configure_app_store_connect.html>`_.
* A `Flutter <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>`_ project located at the root of your git repository.

-------------
Configuration
-------------

To use Github Actions there are 2 possibilities, use the GitHub's runner (paid solution) or use the self-hosted runners (free solution).
If you want use the free solution, you can add a self-hosted runner to your repository by going to *repository's settings*  **>** *Actions* **>**  *Runners*  **>** *New self-hosted runner* button and follow the tutorial for your os. 

.. note:: 
    When using a GitHub runner or self-hosted runner, the only difference is the way to call the runner. You should replace ``ubuntu-latest`` by ``[personal_runner_label]``

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creation of actions file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To work properly you need to create this folder at the root of your project 

.. code-block::

    mkdir -p .github/workflows/

Inside workflows you will create a ``github_actions.yml`` file. This is where we will add the actions.
Here is an example :

.. code-block:: yaml

    name : appollo ci

    on: ['push']

    jobs:
      check_validity_flutter:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: "Run tests" 
        steps:
          # extract repo
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

          - name: Install flutter
            run: sudo snap install flutter --classic

          - name: Run unit test
            run: flutter test


      build_ipa:
        needs: check_validity_flutter
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: "Build IPA file"
        if: github.ref != 'refs/heads/production'
        steps:
          - name: Install Appollo
            run: pip3 install --no-input appollo 

          - name: Connection
            run : appollo signin --email ${{ secrets.EMAIL_APPOLLO }} --password  ${{ secrets.PASSWORD_APPOLLO }}

          - name: Building the IPA
            run: appollo build start --build-type=ad-hoc ${{ secrets.APPLICATION_KEY }}

          - name: Disconnection
            run : appollo signout


      deploy:
        needs: build_ipa
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: "Publication app" 
        
        # only do this if we pushed on 'production' branch
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/production'
        steps:
          - name: Install Appollo
            run: pip3 install --no-input appollo 
            
          - name: Connection
            run : appollo signin --email ${{ secrets.EMAIL_APPOLLO }} --password  ${{ secrets.PASSWORD_APPOLLO }}

          - name: Publication
            run: appollo build start --build-type=publication ${{ secrets.APPLICATION_KEY }}
          
          - name: Disconnection
            run : appollo signout

In this exemple we have 3 variables:

* *EMAIL_APPOLLO* is the email to connect to your account on appollo
* *PASSWORD_APPOLLO* is the password to connect to your account on appollo
* *APPLICATION_KEY* is the key off your application. 

Here is the `documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository>`_ for variables on Github

.. note:: 
    If you forgot the application's Appollo key you can use this following command :  ``appollo app ls``

-----
Usage
-----

Now that all is configured you don't need to do anything else. The previously made worflow is called on each push no matter the branch because we specified *on: ['push']* in our configuration file.  
However the last jobs are only called if there was a push on the ``production`` branch and the second job isn't called in this case.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
View the actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you push your code on Github you can show the workflow executed or in execution in the section *Actions* of the repository

.. image:: /img/ci_cd_github_repo_bar.jpg

If the unit tests have been successfully passed and the build ipa succeeded you get back the url to the IPA, either to download it, or to install it if opened (in safari) from an iOS device.

Finally if the push was on the production branch the workflow will publish your app on the App Store directly. You can then either test your application through testflight or submit the latest version to Apple.

And that's it with this tutorial you have learned how to use Appollo with Github Actions.
