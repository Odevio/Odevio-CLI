About
-----
**Our mission is to reduce the time it takes to setup, build and release Flutter
apps on iOS to the bare minimum.**

The Appollo initiative finds its source in the frustration many developers face
to build and release Flutter mobile applications to iOS.
A few of us got together to solve this issue once and for all and relieve
future Flutter developers of this intense pain.

The tool allows developers working alone or in teams and on
multiple OS (Linux, Windows, MacOS) to build and publish their apps easily
to the app store.

**What can Appollo be used for ?**

#. It allows you to setup the XCode project on a remote MacOS machine if you do not own one.
#. It manages common iOS specific settings for your team : certificates, devices, provisioning profiles, bundle IDs, Xcode configuration files, ...
#. It builds your Flutter app on remote iOS machines.
#. It hosts the iOS app artifacts or publish them to the App Store.
